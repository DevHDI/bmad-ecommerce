# ShopFlow - Product Brief

## Vision

Build a fast, beautiful, and affordable e-commerce platform that empowers small businesses to compete with enterprise retailers online.

## Problem

Small businesses lose an estimated 30% of potential online sales due to poor website performance, confusing checkout flows, and lack of mobile optimization. Existing solutions force a choice between expensive managed platforms and complex self-hosted solutions.

## Solution

ShopFlow provides a modern, high-performance e-commerce platform with:

- **Blazing-fast product catalog** with instant search and filtering
- **Frictionless checkout** in 4 steps or fewer
- **Mobile-first design** that looks and performs perfectly on all devices
- **Simple admin tools** that don't require technical knowledge
- **Developer-friendly architecture** for customization

## Target Market

- Small-to-medium businesses with 50-5000 products
- Online-first brands and DTC companies
- Businesses migrating from WooCommerce or basic Shopify plans

## Key Differentiators

1. **Performance**: Sub-second page loads using Next.js server components and edge caching
2. **Developer Experience**: Clean codebase, TypeScript, modern tooling
3. **Cost**: Self-hostable, no per-transaction fees beyond payment processing
4. **Customization**: Headless architecture allows any frontend design

## Success Criteria

- 90+ Lighthouse performance score on all pages
- < 65% cart abandonment rate
- < 30 seconds for any admin task
- > 99.9% uptime
